**Millennium Blades** is a [board game](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/151347/millennium-blades) about a group of friends who play a fictional collectible card game, which is also called Millennium Blades.

You begin the game on pre-release night with just your starter deck. Youâ€™ll open new packs, form collections, and sell your junk cards on the aftermarket to buy hot new cards. Trade with your friends, build up your deck, and prepare to compete at Millennium Blades Worlds for the title of World Champion!

This website is a wiki for the cards within Millennium Blades. Most of the singles from the game should be here. This includes the Set Rotation, Decked Out, and Collusion/Draw Power expansions. The images were taken from the Tabletop Simulator mod. The descriptions were taken from the Card List spreadsheet by the user MrKarato from the Level 99 Games [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/4u4Y6Hr). Many thanks to the community for these assets!

If you notice a missing card or low quality image, please let me know by opening a GitHub [issue](https://github.com/dnguy4/mb-db/issues). The wiki is an unofficial fan-work, and is not endorsed or approved by Level 99 Games.
