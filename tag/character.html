            <p>DECKBUILDING POWER | At the start of the game, gain your Mystery set. | During deckbuilding, you must make a separate deck of 12 cards. This is your Mystery Deck. | At any time, swap a card in your binder with a same-SET card in the Store Area. | When the Deckbuilding Phase ends, shuffle your Mystery Deck. || TOURNAMENT POWER | You may only play cards from the top of your Mystery Deck. If you can't play a card from the deck, discard it and play a card from your hand. | As an Action, pay 5 Dollars to put a Sell Marker on the next card you play this turn. | As an Action, you may remove a Sell Marker from a card in your tableau to activate one of its Play, Flip, or Score effects immediately.</p>

These cards may be included in your deck even if you already have 8. You may not include a card that shares a name with a card you already have in your deck or with another card you chose. || TOURNAMENT POWER | You can have two Actions on your turn. | As an Action, swap the positions of two cards in your tableau and gain RP equal to the STAR of the lower one (max. 10 RP).
